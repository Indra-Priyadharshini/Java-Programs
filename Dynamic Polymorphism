/*Create three classes Person, Professor and Student. The class Person should have data members name and age. The classes Professor and Student should inherit from the class Person.
The class Professor should have two integer members: publications and Empid. There will be two instance methods: getdata and putdata. The function getdata should get the input from the user: the name, age and publications of the professor. The function putdata should print the name, age, publications and the Empid of the professor.
The class Student should have two data fields: marks, which is an array of size 3  and studID. It has two instance methods: getdata and putdata. The function getdata should get the input from the user: the name, age, and the marks of the student in 3 subjects. The function putdata should print the name, age, sum of the marks and the studID of the student.
For each object being created of the Professor or the Student class, sequential id's should be assigned to them starting from 1 .
Solve this problem using dynamic polymorphism, constructors and static variables.  Create two objects each for both Professor Class and Student Class.
Sample Input:
Walter 50 98
Jessie 25 15
White 18 89 96 96
Pinkman 19 54 52 45

Name:Walter
